summary: "
  I graduated with MSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Saskatchewan.
  During my graduate studies, I focused on scientific computing, numerical methods, and applied mathematics.
  Recently, I have joined Jarvis as a software developer/data engineer. At Jarvis, I have learned the
  agile software development lifecycle practices
  and got hands-on experience with a broad stack of backend and data engineering technologies (including Spring Boot, Hibernate, REST API, Linux, etc.).
  I strive to deliver software products of the highest quality that satisfy the
  client's needs, and are easily maintained by other developers.
  Overall, I am excited to work on challenging projects and to contribute to their success as a part of a team.

    description: "The project presents a collection of Bash and SQL scripts to automate the aggregation and persistence of hardware and real-time resource usage data from a cluster of Linux servers.
    The application utilizes a PostgreSQL database server deployed through the docker."
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "Twitter App: Developed a command-line client to interact with the Twitter REST API.
      The application provides basic CRUD operations on tweets, such as post/show/delete tweets.
      The application is written in Java, using Spring framework for dependency management, and follows the MVC architecture. The project is packaged using Maven and is distributed as a Docker image."
      - "JDBC App: Programmed a DAO layer between PostgreSQL database and Java code. It allows performing CRUD operations on retail business entities by mapping the Java objects to the relational database tables through the JDBC interface."
      - "Grep App: Developed a Java implementation of the Linux `grep` utility to recursively search for a pattern in files of a given directory. The app is implemented using Java Streams and Lambdas, allowing it to effectively process very large files using limited amount of memory. It is packaged using Maven, built into a docker image and distributed through Docker Hub."
  - name: "Springboot App"
    git_url: "/springboot"
    description: "Developed a proof-of-concept application that provides a REST API to trade financial securities and manage
     customers' portfolios. The project is written in Java and relies on Spring framework for IoC
     and Spring MVC for the handling of HTTP requests. Additionally, Hibernate framework was used for ORM between the Java code and the postgres database.
     The application is distributed as a docker image and can be run as a microservice."
  - name: "Python Data Analytics"
    git_url: "/python_data_analytics"
    description: "Performed data analysis of a retail company's transactions using Python and Pandas library.
    The project identifies different groups of customers based on their transactions statistics
    and provides an informational basis for targeted actions to increase the company's efficiency and profitability.
    The project is distributed as a Jupyter notebook that acts as an end client of the company's OLAP data pipeline.
    "
  - name: "Hadoop"
    git_url: "/hadoop"
    description: "Deployed a Hadoop cluster using Google Cloud Platform and explored the main components of Hadoop ecosystem, including HDFS, YARN and Hive.
    Extracted and transformed the 2016 world development index data using Hive and Zeppelin notebook.
    Performed an analysis of the data using Hive query language and compared the performance of different optimizations,
    including the columnar data format (Parquet) and hive partitions.
    The project is distributed as a Zeppelin notebook."
