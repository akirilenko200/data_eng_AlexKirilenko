  But as the riper should by time decease,
  Now is the time that face should form another,
  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
  For never-resting time leads summer on
  Or ten times happier be it ten for one,
  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
  If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
  If all were minded so, the times should cease,
  When I do count the clock that tells the time,
  That thou among the wastes of time must go,
  Where wasteful time debateth with decay
  Who will believe my verse in time to come
    But were some child of yours alive that time,
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  And every fair from fair sometime declines,
  When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
  But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
  And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
  Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
    This wish I have, then ten times happy me.
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.  
  When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
  I must attend, time's leisure with my moan.  
  Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
  Against that time (if ever that time come)
  Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
  Against that time do I ensconce me here
  That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
  So is the time that keeps you as my chest
  Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.
  Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
  I have no precious time at all to spend;
  I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
  That you your self may privilage your time
    And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand
  For such a time do I now fortify
  When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,
  Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?
  Thy worth the greater being wooed of time,
  That time of year thou mayst in me behold,
  Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
  Why with the time do I not glance aside
  Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
  And yet this time removed was summer's time,
  In gentle numbers time so idly spent,
  If time have any wrinkle graven there,
  And make time's spoils despised everywhere.
    Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
  When in the chronicle of wasted time,
  Of this our time, all you prefiguring,
  Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
    Where time and outward form would show it dead.
  Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
  But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents
  Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,
  And given to time your own dear-purchased right,
  As I by yours, y'have passed a hell of time,
  As subject to time's love or to time's hate,
  Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
    To this I witness call the fools of time,
  May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.
